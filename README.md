All NPCs that are currently in the game have (poorly written) dialogue.
All areas (with the exception of K226) that are currently in the game are fully functional.
K226 is currently being worked on.
There is one mostly functional battle in the game right now.
The game fuctions rather well and you can move around as well as interact with other NPCs, so it's at least better than, like, 83% of the games in this class.
