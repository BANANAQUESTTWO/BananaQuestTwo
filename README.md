All NPCs that are currently in the game have (poorly written) dialogue.
All areas (with the exception of K226) that are currently in the game are fully functional.
K226 is currently being worked on. Entering will cause problems. Don't do it.
You can move around and interact with other things, so it's at least better than, like, 83% of the games in this class.
